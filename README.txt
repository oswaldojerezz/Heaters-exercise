Programming Challenge
=====================

First, setup a computer or virtual machine with a LAMP stack.
(Debian is preferred but any Linux will do; database can be either MySQL or MariaDB; PHP is preferred over Python; a virtual machine might be easier for you to bring with you to our office.)

Create a page that displays data from the database when the user hovers over a well with the mouse (or, if you prefer mobile, when the user taps on the well).
Present the data in whatever way you think will benefit the user and demonstrate your ability to create a professional interface.
Use git (not github) to keep a history of the development of your solution.

Resources provided:
	- SQL data (db.sql)
	- SVG map (map.svg, map.css)
